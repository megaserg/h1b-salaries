# H-1B salaries distribution graph

Scatterplot of salaries from H-1B cases that have been submitted to Department of Labor in 2013.
One point on the plot corresponds to one H-1B case.
You can choose one or several companies, one or several job titles (synonyms are supported), and specify salary range.
You can share the resulting graph using the automatically generated URL.

## Implementation
The raw CSV data is downloaded and parsed in the browser by the client-side script.
All filtering and rendering happens on client-side too.
